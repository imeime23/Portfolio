    and tactical level in the conduct of complex operations and intelligence initiatives. I'm multilingual, 
    highly trustworthy, results-oriented, and versatile. Expert in transforming and managing client and customer 
    relationships, nourishing multi-national organization and government partnerships, and implementing practical
